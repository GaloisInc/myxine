This package provides the core library to represent and manipulate dynamic
webpages in the [Myxine](https://github.com/kwf/myxine) GUI server.

**Stability:** While this package will adhere to semantic versioning, do not
expect its API to be very stable for the time being. It is in flux during the
development process of the Myxine server itself.
