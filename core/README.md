This package provides the core library to represent and manipulate dynamic
webpages in the [Myxine](https://github.com/GaloisInc/myxine) GUI server.

**Stability:** while versioning will adhere to the semantic versioning protocol,
do not expect the API of this library to be very stable for the time being, as
it is in flux during the development process of the Myxine server itself.
